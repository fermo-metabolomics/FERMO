    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_dicts : `dict`
        Feature_ID(keys):feature_dict(values).
    infile : `str`
        path to reference spectral library mgf file.
    spec_sim_tol : `float`
        specifies the max tolerance between two fragments to match them
    spec_sim_score_cutoff : `float`
        minimal score to keep connection between two spectra (mod.cosine)
    spec_sim_min_matched : `int`
        minimal number of matched peaks for a match between spectra to
        be considered

    Returns
    -------
    feature_dicts : `dict`

    Notes
    -----
    Inspired by the tutorial of Florian Huber

    analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee)

    Function to perform spectral library matching of feature objects
    against a user-provided spectral library
    (currently the cleaned GNPS library of user-submitted entries,
    downloaded on 26.06.2022).

    Cleaning procedure: matchms returns a generic error if the provided
    library file contains malformed entries. By trial-and-error, these
    entries were pinpointed and removed.
    Therefore, mgf file entries:
    -must not have pepmass=0.0
    -must not have pepmass=1.0

    The similarity measure is a ModifiedCosine due to its recently
    reported better performace than other similarity measures (see
    https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.01.494370).

    Matched against the library are only features that:
    -have a MS2 spectrum (i.e. not MS1 only)
    -are not medium components

    Matches of features against library entries are appended to
    feature objects provided that:
    -the score of the match was >= user-set parameter
    -the number of matched peaks was  > user-set parameter
    This restricts the number of matches that are reported.
