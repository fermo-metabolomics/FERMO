    """Determine bioactivity-associated features, append to feature dicts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bioactivity_samples : `Pandas.DataFrame`
    samples : `dict`
        dict of pandas dataframes of sample-specific features, with
        key=sample_name : value=pandas.df
    feature_dicts : `dict`
        Feature_ID(keys):feature_dict(values)
    bioact_factor : `int`
        factor to determine if a feature, detected in both an active
        and an inactive sample, can be considered to be bioactivity
        associated
    sample_stats : `dict`
        dict containing general info on dataset, inclucing sample list
    filename : `str` or `None`

    Returns
    -------
    feature_dicts : `dict`

    Notes
    -----
    Compares set of features from bioactive samples against set
    of features from inactive samples (non-redundant).

    For features from active samples, keep the lowest intensity.
    For features from inactive samples, keep the highest intensity.

    If a feature is found only in active samples, count it as an
    activity-associated feature.
    If a feature is found in both an active and an inactive sample,
    compare the intensities: the minimum intensity detected
    for activity, and the maximum intensity detected for inactivity.
    If the minimum active intensity is n times higher (e.g. 5)
    than the maximum inactive intensity, count as an activity-associated
    feature. Else, consider inactive.

    Example:
        Consider a feature from samples A (active) and I (inactive).
        If (feature A/feature I) >= 10, consider active.

    Limitations:
    Logic is valid only if:
    -same injection volume was used for all sample in mass spec analysis
    -samples in bioactivity analysis were in the same dilution as in
    mass spec analysis.

    Also, the bioactivity value per sample is stored in the
    "list_bioactivities" attribute in the Feature Objects,
    following sorting of "presence_samples" attribute.
